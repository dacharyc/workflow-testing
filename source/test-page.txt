This is a test page. It has some basic text on it.

I want to include some initial code-block directives just to confirm it won't
flag existing code blocks.

.. code-block:: shell

   Some text on the command line.

And then maybe the other directive just to be sure.

.. code:: shell

   Some more text on the command line, using a different directive.
